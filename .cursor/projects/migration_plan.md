# Knowledge Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating existing knowledge from the global knowledge management system to the new project-isolated system.

## Migration Goals
1. Preserve all existing knowledge without loss
2. Automatically classify knowledge as global or project-specific
3. Maintain knowledge relationships and cross-references
4. Ensure data integrity throughout the migration process
5. Provide rollback capability if needed

## Current State Analysis

### Global Knowledge Files
- `.cursor/memory/lessons.md` - Global lessons and experiences
- `.cursor/think/todo.md` - Global tasks and planning
- `.cursor/tool/tools.md` - Global tools and utilities

### Knowledge Categories Identified
Based on analysis of existing content:

#### Global Knowledge (Stay in Global)
- Cursor IDE usage patterns
- General programming principles
- Development workflow best practices
- Tool usage across projects
- System-level configurations
- Meta-knowledge about knowledge management

#### Project-Specific Knowledge (To be Migrated)
- Project-specific lessons and experiences
- Project-specific tasks and milestones
- Project-specific configurations
- Project-specific troubleshooting

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Classification
1. **Content Analysis**
   - Parse existing knowledge files
   - Extract knowledge entries and metadata
   - Identify knowledge relationships
   - Apply classification rules

2. **Classification Decision**
   - Use classification rules to determine global vs project-specific
   - Calculate confidence scores for each classification
   - Flag entries requiring manual review
   - Generate migration report

### Phase 2: Project Detection and Setup
1. **Project Discovery**
   - Scan workspace for projects
   - Register projects in project registry
   - Create project knowledge structures
   - Set up project-specific files

2. **Project Context Mapping**
   - Map project-specific knowledge to appropriate projects
   - Handle knowledge that spans multiple projects
   - Resolve conflicts and duplicates

### Phase 3: Knowledge Migration
1. **Global Knowledge Preservation**
   - Keep global knowledge in existing locations
   - Update global knowledge index
   - Maintain global knowledge relationships

2. **Project Knowledge Migration**
   - Move project-specific knowledge to project files
   - Update project knowledge indexes
   - Establish cross-references between global and project knowledge

3. **Relationship Preservation**
   - Maintain knowledge relationships across boundaries
   - Update cross-references and links
   - Preserve knowledge evolution history

### Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
1. **Data Integrity Verification**
   - Verify all knowledge has been migrated
   - Check for data loss or corruption
   - Validate knowledge relationships
   - Confirm classification accuracy

2. **System Optimization**
   - Update search indexes
   - Optimize knowledge graphs
   - Clean up temporary files
   - Update system statistics

## Migration Tools

### Analysis Tools
- `knowledge_analyzer.py` - Analyze existing knowledge content
- `classification_engine.py` - Apply classification rules
- `relationship_mapper.py` - Map knowledge relationships

### Migration Tools
- `knowledge_migrator.py` - Execute knowledge migration
- `project_setup.py` - Set up project structures
- `index_updater.py` - Update knowledge indexes

### Validation Tools
- `integrity_checker.py` - Verify data integrity
- `migration_validator.py` - Validate migration results
- `rollback_manager.py` - Manage rollback operations

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Mitigation through comprehensive backup and validation
- **Classification Errors**: Mitigation through manual review of low-confidence classifications
- **Relationship Breakage**: Mitigation through careful relationship mapping

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigation through staged migration
- **User Confusion**: Mitigation through clear documentation and training
- **System Downtime**: Mitigation through offline migration

### Low Risk
- **File Permission Issues**: Mitigation through proper permission handling
- **Encoding Problems**: Mitigation through UTF-8 enforcement

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Data integrity check failures
- User-reported issues
- System performance degradation
- Classification accuracy below threshold

### Rollback Process
1. Stop all migration activities
2. Restore from backup
3. Revert system configuration
4. Notify users of rollback
5. Analyze failure causes
6. Plan revised migration approach

## Success Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- All existing knowledge preserved
- Classification accuracy > 90%
- All knowledge relationships maintained
- System performance maintained or improved

### Quality Criteria
- No data loss or corruption
- All cross-references functional
- Search functionality working correctly
- User acceptance of new system

### Performance Criteria
- Migration completed within acceptable time
- System response time maintained
- Resource usage within acceptable limits
